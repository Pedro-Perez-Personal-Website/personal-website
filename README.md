Hello there!

This is my website, were you can find my portfolio.
It consist of three HTML files, one CSS and some JScript code.

Have fun.


We got sections that let us divide the main page. Some sections have container properties
that let them behave in ciertos manner.


We use "about" and "portfolio" classes to style different parts of a page in between documents.
