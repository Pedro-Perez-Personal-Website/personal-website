Hello there!

This is my website, were you can find my projects and a little something about me.
It consist of three HTML files, one CSS and some JScript code.

Have fun.

We use sections and articles to separate related content. 
A body the holds the entire content of the page.
The Header that has a list of links and a logo.
Sections let us divide the main page. 

There is two types of classes that let us style the website. We got classes that let us know in what page we are, and a container class to add flex layout.
classes:
.portfolio
.about
.home
.container

We also have ID's that work across pages like the navigation bar and the footer.
id:
#nav
#footer
#logo
