                Here's a picture of my son and I chilling on the chairs beside de pool on a summer day. He just 
                told me how he couldn't wait for summer to start and go back. He loves pools and mole.
                He is 7 and growing. Being a dad at a young age has help me be more responsible and have a clear goal.
                Our well being. When I saw all the benefits and help Amazon provide I was excited to 
                get to my programming path. I think learning a programming language is a very important skill
                for this next century. I wanna be able to share this abilities with him and
                transmit all this excitement and the power of javascript.

                The first time I did contact with Rotaract I was in Ensenada, about to go to Alaska for a summer job.
                Then, when I came back a few years later, on Tj I found a club and participate in some activities but 
                it didn't last long because I had to move again.
                This time I ready and loaded. I just became member last month and cant wait for summer because I'll be part of the board.
                There's a lot of potential in our team and we are ready to help our community in this hard times.
                Being at Rotaract means team work, and multidisciplinary work. This skills are also used in the developing teams.
                Helping the community and transmitting those values to my son are why I join Rotaract.

                I think my first  contact with an html file was on elementery school 
                And I believe we use a combination of word, text editor, and paint. 
                I really don't remember what we use but I was very surprise with what I 
                had built. Saddly I wouldn't had contact with it till High School. There 
                I use Dreamweaver and things got easier. Now with all the tools at hand, 
                I'm ready to build something cool.
